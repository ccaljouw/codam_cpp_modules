The orthodox canonical class form (before C++11)

In C++98 and C++03 the OCCF had four different methods that the C++ compiler is willing to generate:

Default constructor
Copy constructor
Destructor
Copy assignment operator

class A final
{
   public:
      A ();
      A (const A &a);
      ~A ();
      A & operator = (const A &a);
};
