// The orthodox canonical class form (before C++11)

// In C++98 and C++03 the OCCF had four different methods that the C++ compiler is willing to generate:

// Default constructor
// Copy constructor
// Destructor
// Assignment operator

class A final
{
   public:
      A ();
      A (const A &a);
      ~A ();
      A & operator = (const A &a);
};

// copy constructor: 
// A copy constructor is used to initialize a previously uninitialized object from some other objects data.
Sample(const Sample& t) {
    this.data = t.data
}

// Assignment operator:
// An assignment operator is used to replace the data of a previously initialized object with some other objects data.  
Sample&  operator=(const Sample& t) {
	this.data = t.data;
	return *this;
} 	

// C03 ex03 why does the include not work correct?
// include copy and assignment constructors?
// lookup flags
